# SI-AMP

This machine problem is based on an article entitled "The dynamics of message passing on dense graphs, with applications to compressed sensing" by Bayati and Montanari.
Therein, they describe approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms as a means to solve several signal processing problems.
We want to explore this class of algorithms for the three examples given in the articles: linear estimation, compressed sensing via soft thresholding, and multi-user detection.
The goal is to understand how fast SE convergence becomes an accurate predictor of performance as a function of the matrix size.

## Tasks

Create one iPython nobook for each AMP algorithm.
Test performance as a function of size.
Produce one plot for each problem.
